	<h3>Getting a Mobile Connection in Singapore</h3>
<p>You're a college student, and an international one at that – of course you need a mobile phone connection! Whether you want your parents to be able to contact you easily, continue that endless stream of texts to your significant other back home, download all sorts of apps on that shiny new iPhone, or become a BBM-wielding <del>socialite</del> person, here's a look at what your options are.</p>

<p>There are three mobile connection providers in Singapore: <a href="http://info.singtel.com/personal/communication/mobile">SingTel</a>, <a href="http://www.starhub.com/mobile.html">StarHub</a> and <a href="http://www.m1.com.sg/M1/site/M1Corp/">M1</a>. They're all fairly decent in terms of coverage, with SingTel and StarHub being the two more popular choices.</p>

<p>A little heads up though: whatever you were paying for a mobile connection in India, you will most certainly be paying more in Singapore. And some plans still charge you for incoming calls – it's okay, many of us still haven't gotten over the shock of that yet.</p>

<h4>Prepaid or post-paid?</h4>

<p>Getting a prepaid plan is a breeze: simply whip out your passport, [possibly] get to choose from a list of numbers, and you're done. Most students get a prepaid plan within their first week of being here; in fact, you can purchase one right at Changi Airport.</p>

<p>Post-paid plans often offer benefits like free campus calls, free SMSes and so on, which works out cheaper for many people in the long run. There are some great deals on handsets if you purchase a two-year contract. You also most certainly will have to go for a post-paid plan for any moderate-to-heavy data usage. However, students require their Student's Pass before they can opt for a post-paid plan, so you will likely have to wait a couple of weeks before you can get one.</p>

<h4>What about a handset?</h4>

<p>There's a good chance you already have a handset; bring it along, use a pre-paid connection for a few weeks and then decide whether you want to stick to it or switch to post-paid.</p>

<p>If you don't have a handset or want to buy a new one, it will often be cheaper to purchase it from India, unless you're getting it with a post-paid contract.
You can check out the latest deals on postpaid plans at the respective connection providers' websites.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Bring an inexpensive basic phone (one of the cheap Nokia ones, for example) as a back-up. You never know when your cellphone might fail – because of firmware issues, battery problems, accidental dropping resulting in a shattered screen, and so on. <!-- getting dunked in the sea at East Coast Park, or in extreme (and rare) cases, being overrun by one of the shuttle buses on campus. --></p>

<h4>What about calls to India?</h4>

<p>Calling India is quite cheap (relatively speaking, of course).</p>

<p>Prepaid connections have special rates for some countries including India (you need to prefix certain digits to the number you're calling – ask the shop assistant for help), and there are top-up cards with special balance just for making international calls.</p>

<p>In case you don't want international dialing enabled on your post-paid connection, you can purchase a calling card for India, which also offers really low call rates.</p>
